# Legacy Android System Contributions (2016 - 2019) 📱

Before transitioning to Cloud & NLP Research, my technical journey started with system-level tinkering on the Android ecosystem. I was actively involved in rooting, flashing, and beta-testing custom software for various devices.

### 🚀 Key Technical Highlights
* **System Debugging:** Performed extensive testing of Custom ROMs (LineageOS, Resurrection Remix) and Kernels on 10+ devices.
* **Flashing & Recovery:** Expert in managing bootloaders, TWRP recovery, and ADB/Fastboot commands for system maintenance.
* **Device Expertise:** Tested and optimized builds for devices like **Redmi Note 3 (Kenzo)**, **Redmi 2**, **Yu Euphoria**, and **Redmi 10**.
* **Community Contribution:** Maintained a repository on **AndroidFileHost** to share optimized resources with the enthusiast community.
