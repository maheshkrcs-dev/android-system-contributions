### 🛠️ System Testing & Debugging (2016-2018)
I was an active beta-tester for the custom Android community, focusing on system stability and kernel optimization.

* **Beta Testing:** Conducted rigorous testing for Custom ROMs (LineageOS, Resurrection Remix) across 10+ devices.
* **Kernel Logs:** Analyzed logcat and dmesg outputs to identify bootloops and hardware abstraction layer (HAL) issues.
* **Supported Devices:** Redmi Note 3, Redmi 2, Yu Euphoria, Redmi 10, etc.
